While the exact details of how to handle zip files depends on whether you are on a PC or Mac, the browser you are using, and the tool you are using
to unzip or decompress the file, here are some general guidelines to follow: 
                                
1.	Create a folder on your computer where you will want to store the files.
2.	Click on the .zip file on the web page.
3.	Read and accept the license agreement.
4.	From your browser, you can either save or open the downloaded zip file. 
5.	Save the file to your computer if you think you may want to unzip it again later. (This is recommended because it will save you the trouble of downloading it again from support.sas.com.)
6.	Go to the location where you saved the zip file. 
7.	Either double click or right click the zip file. 
8.	In the interface that appears, look for a button or a selection to unzip or extract the files. 
9.	You will be prompted to choose a location on your computer to put the files. Choose the folder you created for this purpose
and confirm your selection.
